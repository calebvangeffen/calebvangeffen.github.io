title: About Caleb
subtitle: A brief introduction
---

My name is Caleb Van Geffen. I was born in New Orleans, Louisiana where at the young age of six I was forced to evacuate from Hurricane Katrina to Birmingham, Alabama. My parents saw better opportunity in our new city as we made it our home. My parents built a carpet cleaning and upholstery business from the ground up to become one of the premier companies in metro Birmingham. They've always instilled hard work, entrepreneurship, and creativity in my two brothers and I.

I attended Oak Mountain High School where I worked hard in the classroom and had a passion for long-distance running and soccer, which I competed on our Varsity programs since freshman year. Vanderbilt University was my dream school ever since I began to think about college in middle school. I attended Vanderbilt and ran cross country and track against some of the nation's best athletes while gaining a B.S. in Computer Science and a M.S. in Civil Engineering. I never achieved everything I wanted to in collegiate running, but have set high goals to eventually run at the Olympic Trials in the Marathon as I think the distance suits me more than races I've past competed in.

This website began as a passion project to learn web development, but has developed into a blog as well as advertising for my love for coaching, tutoring, and coding. Feel free to explore and contact me with any needs you may have.
