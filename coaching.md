As much as I hate to admit it, I think I get more joy out of seeing others exceed their goals rather than mine (although I wish I was wired differently). I have always wanted to be a coach for longer distances in running and just started pursuing this in 2022. I currently only have two athletes, but love writing training and helping them reach their dreams.

## Current Athletes

### Matthew "Pesto" Estopinal
* Pesto was Caleb's first ever athlete starting in October 2022. He was an extremely talented collegiate at Vanderbilt University where he achieved All-Region honors in cross country. He also boasted impressive PRs in track, running 29:33 for the 10,000m at Raleigh Relays. Matthew has run two races under my coaching.
- Indy Monumental Half Marathon 1:07:06
- Belle Meade Boulevard Bolt 5 mile 24:36

### Mary Morgan Estopinal
* Mary Morgan is Matthew's twin sister and started working with me in December 2022. She has goals of running sub 2 hours in the half marathon in April 2023 at the Jersey City Half Marathon. I'm super excited to see how many minutes we can knock off her current 2:20 PR.
