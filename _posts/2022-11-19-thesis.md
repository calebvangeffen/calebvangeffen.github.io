After one and a half years, tens of thousands of code lines, and countless 40+ hour weeks in my lab - I've finally submitted my thesis and had it approved by the Vanderbilt School of Engineering. 

Now all that is left for me to receive my M.S. in Civil Infrastructure Systems (Civil Engineering) is to pass my final two classes. This has been an incredibly rewarding journey in which I learned so many skills I didn't possess previously.

I was tasked to create an entire system architecture to support artificial intelligence on the I-24 Smart Corridor between Nashville and Murfreesboro in Tennessee. The system was coded in Python and utilized multiprocessing to manage all the moving parts required by a system of this magnitude. I had to learn database management, logging fundamentals, visualization integrations, development workflow, and tons of other skills that will stay with me for many years.
